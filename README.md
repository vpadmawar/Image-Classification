# Image-Classification

# Bing Downloader is used for downloading all the images so no need to manually download the images

# STEPS IN PROJECT
1. Gathering of data - bing downloader
2. Preprocessing of data
3. SVM classification Algorithm using GridSearch CV
4. Model is evaluated using confusion matrix
5. Prediction 

# Project Goal
The goal of the project is to gather images, preprocess the data and by applying a suitable classification algorithm, evaluate the model to predict any new image.
